### Submit Technical Documentation Outline

**Submit by 5pm on Friday 4/19**

- Send an email to your advisor and me with a link to you google doc. Be professional.

- Make the most out of this revision: it’s great to request specific feedback from your advisor! Is there any section you’d particularly like their input on? Let them know in your message. You can also tag us in comments inside your document.

For each section: 

1. include as much information as completed to date 
2. note the extent to which the section is completed and any remaining obstacles to its completion. 

As an appendix to the outline:

1. describe the work to be completed during the remainder of Spring Quarter 
2. include a timeline for remaining tasks and deliverables.

Submit an expanded version of your TD outline by 1 pm on Wednesday 4/17.
Add your document to our [shared folder Week 3 - TD Outline submission](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Z6TLkg-sKhZY4OsgOwCetiy-iUw16UPh?usp=share_link). 

You can continue working on the [week 3 shared folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Z6TLkg-sKhZY4OsgOwCetiy-iUw16UPh?usp=share_link) for your final outline submission.
