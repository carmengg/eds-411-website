### Complete Course Surveys

Thank you completing these! Your feedback really helps to improve the capstone courses!

1. [UCSB Course Evaluation](https://ucsb.bluera.com/ucsb)

2. [Internal Course Survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5ytdKeI0vduJyZMYPBHBsxSi1-ct6su6KyQ22U0jf9688hA/viewform?usp=pp_url)


### Submit final Technical Documentation and GitHub repository

- Your faculty advisor must have approved it before submitting it.
- Collect signature from your advisor (first), then me. DocuSign might be the easiest way to do this.
- You will need to upload two *separate* files for your TD:
    1. The final version of your TD with a blank signature page in PDF format with your Capstone Project short name 
    2. The signature page in PDF format.
- Don't forget: Send your final Technical Documentation and a link to your GitHub repository  to your client too. 

### Complete Faculty Advisor Evaluation

### Complete Peer/Self Evaluation
- Each student must complete a Capstone Project Peer & Self Evaluation Form for Winter Quarter. 
- Upload your evaluation form to Box and save your document with your Capstone Project short name and your full name as the file name (e.g., SaferSeafood Emily Case).
- You must also email your peer evaluation directly to your faculty advisor. 

## Congratulations on Finishing Your Capstone Projects!
