## To do by next week

### Keep working on...

Updating your DIP:

- add details about your project your team has gathered while preparing for faculty reviews
- got a cool diagram that succinctly describes your process or model? consider adding it to your DIP

Getting your preliminary results or creating a prototype for review


### Edit and practice your presentation

- Have a mock presentation with your faculty advisor. Prioritize their feedback.
- Make sure you are ready to explain any technical terms you mention in your presentation. 
- I might send you some extra comments and feedback
- Practice! That is half the battle.
- If you would like to iterate once more with me, you‚Äôre welcome to schedule a 30 minute block [on my calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/selfsched?sstoken=UUVMMFRTZXRjRHF6fGRlZmF1bHR8N2I0ZDFiNzg0ZDU1YjEzMzE4MWI5ZTJkYTNjYzgxNmM) on Friday (Manzanita room) or Monday morning (Sequoia room).
