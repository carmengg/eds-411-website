## To do by next week

### Prepare mock presentation 2.0

- I might send you some extra comments and feedback after class
- Incorporate the feedback and streamline your presentation
- Iterate with your faculty advisor
- Practice makes perfect. :-)

### Prepare for Q&A

- Go over this [presentation about best practices to answer questions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1idCPdoY0y-rUTiGJMcERiEhA56iiUypECBBV6_MJ-sM/edit?usp=sharing) about your presentation.
- Identify 4 - 5 bins that you expect faculty review questions to fall into (e.g. model selection, data management, statistical analyses). Write them down.
- Brainstorm who would be most appropriate to respond to questions in each bin.
- Write down 2 - 3 questions in each bin that you might expect (and/or are afraid of getting) during your faculty review
Prepare, if necessary, any extra slides you might need during your Q&A 

### Keep working on...

- Updating your DIP: **all DIPs need more details about their main deliverable**
- Getting your preliminary results or creating a prototype for review
