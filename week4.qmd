* Allocate enough time discuss the Data Management Plan with your team and write it. This is one of the longer sections in the DIP.

* Remember to always read the Capstone Guidelines first if you have questions about how to write any of the DIP sections!

* Check the DIP length requirements in the Capstone Guidelines and start discussing with your team whether you’ll need to shorten it by 2/9.
