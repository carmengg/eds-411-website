## To do by next week

### Reflect

**Context:** your Team Management Plan + Deliverables submissions and flashtalks, and the feedback you received.

Add this point to your next team meeting agenda:

**Discuss what went well and and what could be better. How will our team improve?**

- Is your team delivering high-quality work?

- Do you need to re-read the capstone guidelines?

- Should you seek more feedback or guidance from your - client/advisor?

- Does your team need to share work earlier so everyone can revise?

- Do you need to establish new expectations or ground rules in your team management plan?


### Submit by 1pm on Wednesday 2/7 (before next class)
A single-document draft of the DIP including:

- Draft of DIP Solution Design - Data Management Plan and Documentation Plan sections 
- Updates for all other sections you’ve drafted so far
- Title page, budget and budget justification, and references section
- In summary: everything in the DIP except for the testing plan and executive summary

Add document to the [shared folder Week 4 - DIP draft](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_PUJ3yn71pRWPIXIS7VjGl2v1LBPDNAC?usp=share_link).

# 

* Allocate enough time discuss the Data Management Plan with your team and write it. This is one of the longer sections in the DIP.

* Remember to always read the Capstone Guidelines first if you have questions about how to write any of the DIP sections!

* Check the DIP length requirements in the Capstone Guidelines and start discussing with your team whether you’ll need to shorten it by 2/9.
