## To do by next week

### Prepare faculty review draft slides

1. Read these [guidelines for your presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rMpHTbqVPNEDBZc_o8asS2wf_RsBU7IXkBNN91qx2SA/edit?usp=sharing).
2. Decide with your team what preliminary results, progress, or prototype you will include in your presentation
3. Put together a skeleton slide deck (like an outline, but with the sections as slide headers) and populate them with stuff you have already. Focus on storyline! Consider discussing this outline with your faculty advisor. *Slides must be Google slides. 
4. Decide on who will be presenting in faculty review (and who in public final presentation). Every person in the team should be ready to present if needed.
5. Add your draft to our [shared drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P-kO4Btnb0-vWJPiP5zxzRnpfOHS762P?usp=share_link).

### Prepare to present next week

Practice: 

- Everything we covered on Alexâ€™s workshop!
- Professional presentation: posture, tone, and clear speech
- Using your memory: no notes
- Projecting your voice
- Clearly explaining plots, graphs, and diagrams
- Timing it: 12 minutes no more, no less
- Having your team join you at the end for questions and feedback

## Update your DIP

If you have already received feedback from your advisor:

- discuss feedback with your team
- start working on updating your draft
- contact advisors or clients for clarification and reply to comments within the document as needed. Remember to always do your research and discuss with your team first!
